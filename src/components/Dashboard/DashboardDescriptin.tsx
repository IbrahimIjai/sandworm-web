    description: `
      In July 2025, GMX V1 on Arbitrum was exploited for approximately $42 million, 
due to a re-entrancy vulnerability in its GLP redemption logic. The attacker 
manipulated unstake functions to repeatedly extract funds before balances updated, 
then bridged a portion to Ethereum using CCTP.

While this incident was isolated to GMX V1, it’s part of a broader pattern: 
over $2.3 billion was lost to exploits across all chains in the first half of 2025 alone — 
with bridges, liquidity protocols, and DeFi incentives consistently targeted.

This report focuses on:
      • How the GMX exploit was executed  
      • Onchain fund flows and wallet activity  
      • Cross-chain laundering paths  
      • The ongoing pattern of vulnerabilities in legacy V1 protocols

      Sandworm provides a forensic lens on the mechanics of this attack.

      This dashboard shows the summary of DEGEN Uniswap activity such as transaction count (buy and sell), top wallet interactions, Uniswap burn events, and liquidity activity on Base. It harnesses Sandworm's forensic tools to monitor real-time transaction data, identify dominant wallets, track burn activities, and analyze liquidity contributions, with Degen priced at $0.015 as of July 2025.
